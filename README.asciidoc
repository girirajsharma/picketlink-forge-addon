== Features

Projects addon integration::
   This addon provides several `ProjectFacet` implementations for use in developing `forge-addon` projects. By using the javaee addon, it is possible to add Java EE capabilities to a specific project by adding the required technology as a provided dependency in the build descriptor.
+
Descriptors are handled by the https://github.com/shrinkwrap/descriptors[ShrinkWrap Descriptors] project. Read the Facets addon README to learn how to handle facets in Forge. Below is a table that lists each facet and its purpose.
+
[options="header,asciidoc"]
|===
|Facet|Behavior when installing in a project

|`CDIFacet`
|Adds the necessary CDI 1.x dependencies to the build descriptor. Adds a `META-INF/beans.xml` to your resources directory or to `WEB-INF/beans.xml` if in a Web project. The facet provides access to the `BeansDescriptor` object to allow manipulation of the `beans.xml` file in a fluent way.

|`EJBFacet`
|Adds the necessary EJB 3.x dependencies to the build descriptor. 

|`JAXWSFacet`
|Adds the necessary JAX-WS dependencies to the build descriptor. 

|`JMSFacet`
|Adds the necessary JMS 1.1 dependencies to the build descriptor. 

|`JSTLFacet`
|Adds the necessary JSTL dependencies to the build descriptor. 

|`JTAFacet`
|Adds the necessary JTA dependencies to the build descriptor. 

|`PersistenceFacet`
|Adds the necessary JPA 2.x dependencies to the build descriptor. Adds a `META-INF/persistence.xml` to your project. Provides access to the `PersistenceDescriptor` object to allow manipulation of the `persistence.xml` file in a fluent way. 

|`PersistenceMetaModelFacet`
|Adds the necessary configuration in the build descriptor to enable JPA 2.x meta-model generation. 

|`ServletFacet`
|Adds the necessary Servlet 3.x dependencies to the build descriptor. Adds a `WEB-INF/web.xml` to your project. Provides access to the `WebAppDescriptor` object to allow manipulation of the `web.xml` file in a fluent way.
